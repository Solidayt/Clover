	<h3>Home made and hand made!</h3>
	
	<p>	
	We have been making these unique absorbing coasters with our special blend of clay for over 25 years and sold through east coast craft shows with a very high proportion of repeat customers.  They are a uniquely functional and decorative for any home. We have spent years designing the product to meet our standards and to work the best in your home. No two coasters are unique. Everything we make is all done by hand. 
	<br><br>
	We start with a rolled slab of our special blend of clay and with our box of shells and coral that we have handpicked from beaches on our vacations; we artistically press the shells and coral into the wet clay leaving their imprint.  The coasters are cut, colored, dried, and fired to preserve the image.  Each coaster design is completely individual. 
	
	

<br><br>
	These coasters are perfect around your own home and for any gift occasion.  Everyone can use absorbing coasters; they are perfect for housewarming gifts, hostess gifts, stocking stuffers, weddings, engagements, party favors, and holidays.
