	<h2>Here are some questions you might have</h2>

	
	
		<ol>
			<li><b>How do you clean the coasters?</b> <br><br>
				<ul>
					<li>If the coaster ever needs cleaned, clean with a solution of one part bleach to four parts water.  Place coaster in the solution in a small shallow plate.  Soak the coaster for 20 minutes.  Rinse well and tip the coaster to allow for thorough drying.<br><br></li>
					<li><b>DO NOT USE SOAP</b> or put the coaster in the dishwasher. Soaps leave residues that stop the absorbency.</li>
					</ul>
					<br>
			</li>
			<!--2nd question-->
			<li><b>Which side do you put your glass on?</b><br><br>
				<ul>
					<li>
						While many restaurants and bars use cork coasters they do not absorb moisture.  We use the cork to protect your furniture and the ceramic side is the side that absorbs the moisture.  So place your glass on the ceramic side.
					</li>				
				</ul>
				<br>
			</li>
			
			<li><b>What are the coasters made of?</b><br><br>
				<ul>
					<li>
						The coasters are made of a special blend of earthen ware that we make ourselves.  Since we make our own clay, we chose the materials that allow it to be absorbent and still strong. 
					</li>
				</ul>
				<br>
			</li>
			
			<li><b>Do the coasters break?</b><br><br>
				<ul>
					<li>
						The coasters are not unbreakable but are very strong.  If you drop them on the carpet or hardwood floor they will likely be fine.  If they are dropped on tile or concrete, those materials are less forgiving. We have seen the coasters bounce and we have seen them chip on concrete.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<br>
			</li>
			
			<li><b>Do the colors fade?</b><br><br>
				<ul>
					<li>
						The colors are permanently fired into the clay and do not fade.
					</li>
				</ul>	
				<br>
			</li>
			
			<li><b>Do the coasters change color?</b><br><br>
				<ul>
					<li>
						No the coasters do not change color when wet.					
					</li>
				</ul>
				<br>
			</li>
			
			<li><b>Do the coasters stain?</b><br><br>
				<ul>
					<li>
						The coasters will absorb any liquid including tea, coffee and soda which can cause stains.  However, our coasters are cleanable which removes these stains.					
					</li>
				</ul>
				<br>
			</li>
			
			<li><b>How do you make the coasters?</b><br><br>
				<ul>
					<li>
						We start with a blend of earthenware which we mix in our pug.  Then the clay is rolled out into slabs, the designs are pressed in and the coasters are cut, colored, dried and then fired in a kiln for durability.					
					</li>
				</ul>
				<br>
			</li>
			
			<li><b>Does the glass tip in to the design impressions?</b><br><br>
				<ul>
					<li>
						The bases of glasses are large enough that they are not impacted by the depressions in the images.					
					</li>
				</ul>
				<br>
			</li>
			
			<li><b>How do the coasters work?</b><br><br>
				<ul>
					<li>
						The ceramic material absorbs the moisture that drips of the cold drinks.  The moisture then evaporates back into the air so the coaster is always ready for use.					
					</li>
				</ul>
