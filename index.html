	<p>100% Absorbent Coasters for your home or in your car cup holder.<br><br>
Absorbs the drips that come off all of your cold drinks.<br><br>
Each coaster is handmade and individually hand colored. The seashore
designs are created using a blend of real shells, coral and our original
artwork which are pressed into our special blend of clay and kiln fired for
durability.
<br><br>
The design in our botanical coasters are made with real leaves and
wildflowers hand-picked from our surrounding woodlands, artistically
arranged and pressed into our clay. The colors are hand blended into each
leaf and wildflower to create a unique work of art that has become our
signature item.
These coasters are perfect around for yourself and for any gift occasion.</p>
